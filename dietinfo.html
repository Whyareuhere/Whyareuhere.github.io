		<h3>Why are fruits and vegetables important?</h3>
		<p>Fruits and vegetables contain many vitamins and minerals necessary for maintaining a healthy body. Essential ones such as Vitamin C are so vital your body will break down without it in less than a week! Other foods such as meat, grains, dairy products and oils often do not contain these vitamins and minerals. The only source for replacing these nutrients are either from nutritional supplements and fruits and vegetables!<br><br></p>
		<h4>If fruits and vegetables contain necessary vitamins and minerals, why can’t I just get them from nutritional supplements?</h4> <p>This is a good question! While nutritional supplements do contain the necessary vitamins and minerals, they often cause nausea and stomach cramps even when used properly (often times before or after a meal). But the reason health professionals do not recommend just this is because fruits and vegetables have an additional function.<br> In addition to nutrition, fruits and vegetables contain lots of fiber, which help to scrub out anything stuck inside your intestines. When food goes through the intestines, some of it will end up sticking to the intestine walls, making it much harder for your body to absorb nutrients and minerals it needs. Fiber acts as a sort of scrubber to scrape off that gunk to keep the body able to readily absorb the necessary nutrients and minerals it needs! If you don’t ingest enough fiber, the gunk starts building up, and it becomes hard for your body to absorb the nutrients and minerals it needs leading to life-threatening conditions and diseases. Even before this point it makes it much easier for you to catch diseases and to fall from them - a healthy body has a much better chance of fighting off or preventing diseases from happening in the first place!!</p>
