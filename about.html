		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>Everyone knows that eating their fruits and vegetables is important for their health. However, it becomes much harder to measure when you talk about the different ways the fruits and vegetables are served and consumed in daily life. How many cups is dried fruit worth? Do candied fruits and vegetables count? What about vegetable and fruit juices? Why do some countries count juices as part of fruit and vegetable consumption? What even is the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables, and are there any exceptions?</p>
		<p>This app is intended to give a basic overview of the importance of fruits and vegetables in everyday diet, their nutritional values, a basic conversion of different types of fruit and vegetable products to their raw cup counterparts (used to measure consumption), and recommendations on how to get the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables into your diet cheaply and effectively.</p>
